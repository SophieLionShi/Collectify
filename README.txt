The plugin allows WordPress-based website owners to add smart contracts to pages and blog posts to create token-gated content. 

A visitor who possesses the NFT required by the smart contract can connect their digital wallet to the site and gain access to the "NFT holders only" content. Visitors without NFT will be prompted to mint one to view the content.

With the Collectify plugin, you have the option to add a contract either to an entire page or post using post-level settings, or to specific blocks within posts or pages using block-level settings. 

To add a smart contract to gate your full post or page: 

1. Navigate to Posts/Pages and click on "Add New". 
2. Configure the contract under "Collectify" on the post toolbar on the right-hand side.
3. From there, you can add a contract, choose the blockchain, and enter its address.

To add a smart contract to gate a block of content: 
1. Search for "Collectify" in the Block search box.
2. Select and insert a Collectify block, and the block settings will appear on the right-hand side of the screen. 

After publishing your post or page, readers will be prompted to connect their crypto wallets to access the full content. If they have the necessary NFT, they will be able to view the content. If they do not own the NFT, they will be directed to a minting page where they can create one.

# Getting Started

If you'd like to add a contract to your site, start by [deploying your smart contract](https://launchpad.collectify.app/#/erc721?type=ERC721). We strongly recommend starting with a test network such as Goerli.

Once you have deployed the contract, you can obtain the plugin from the WordPress site. From the administration section of your WordPress.org website, navigate to the Plugins tab and click the "Add New" button. Search for "Collectify" and then click the "Install Now" button to install the plugin.

# Setup of Collectify Plugin

With Collectify plugin, you have the option to add a contract either to entire posts using post-level settings or to specific blocks within posts or pages using block-level settings. Once your post or page includes the content you need, you can preview it like any other post or page in WordPress.

To add a contract to your post or page, please follow the following steps:

1. Navigate to Posts/Pages and click on "Add New".
2. To insert a block, click on the "+" button in the editor.
3. Search for "Collectify" in the search box.
4. Select the Collectify block, and the block settings will appear on the right-hand side of the screen. From there, you can add a contract, choose the blockchain, and enter its address.

After publishing your post or page, your blog readers will be prompted to connect their crypto wallet to access the full content. If they have the necessary NFT, they will be able to view the content. However, if they do not own the NFT, they will be directed to a minting page where they can create one.
